# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

This project is based on the online dataset found on Kaggle. The link to the csv file is the following:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The notebook can be run chronologically to get the results and graphs shown. If you wish to run the project, the slight change you need to make is to change the file's path to match your local path file after you downloaded the csv file.

The link of my original Kaggle notebook is as follows:
